# PHP Unexpected Type Comparisons

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to implicit type conversion during comparisons.  PHP's loose typing can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful about the types of variables you're comparing. This example shows a scenario where a string is compared to an integer, leading to a logical error.

## Problem

The `bug.php` file contains a function that makes an unexpected type comparison, resulting in incorrect program behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.php` file demonstrates the corrected version with explicit type checking to ensure accurate comparisons.
